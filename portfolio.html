            <h2 class="c10" id="h.vj7or5p9inc4"><span>Course Summary</span></h2>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Over the course of this semester, my technical communication skills have
                    grown and
                    become more refined. To begin, I would like to recap my achievements with each major project, to
                    help frame
                    how I worked toward the learning outcomes in this course. I&rsquo;ll also provide an update on my
                    personal
                    goals since my midterm reflection, before finally detailing how I met each course goal using
                    examples from
                    my work. With all of this in mind, and as the final part of my self-evaluation, I&rsquo;ll argue for
                    what
                    grade I believe I have achieved in this class.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c2">In Major Project 1, I gained valuable experience writing cover letters,
                    something I
                    had not done previously, and learned how to effectively revise my resume toward a specific
                    role/industry. I
                    created a portfolio website to give recruiters a chance to see specific examples of my work. I have
                    since
                    applied to job roles using exactly the skills I built during MP1, and have felt all the more
                    confident doing
                    so with the experience from this project.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c2">In Major Project 2, I was able to examine the technical communication
                    successes and
                    fails surrounding the CrowdStrike incident, then concisely, but comprehensively, present it to the
                    class in
                    poster and oral presentation format. There was a large focus with my partner on balancing the amount
                    of
                    information present on the poster and in our oral presentation. We struck a good balance to provide
                    complete
                    information on the poster and still be able to go more in-depth in our class presentation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c4 c9"></span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c2">In Major Project 3, I worked with my group to holistically review the student
                    organization VGDev and decide what technical communication materials they were lacking. Following
                    that, we
                    collaborated to create the deliverables targeting recruiting and new members. Then we constructed a
                    recommendation report to provide our findings and additional recommendations to the organization. We
                    used
                    our own experiences as students throughout this project to imagine what our audiences would find
                    useful and
                    engaging.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c2">At the beginning of the semester, I set personal goals in my Letter to the
                    Instructor, and I evaluated these in my midterm reflection as well. To recap these goals, I wanted
                    to:
                    enhance my job portfolio, increase my cybersecurity skills by completing training challenges, and
                    apply for
                    full-time job positions. These goals were my progression of eventually securing a full-time job, and
                    although I have not succeeded in that yet, I was still able to achieve my personal goals. MP1 went a
                    long
                    way toward improving my job materials, while I was able to keep up with my cybersecurity training
                    alongside
                    coursework. In the time since the midterm reflection, I have applied for a few full-time positions.
                    I am
                    proud of myself for completing my goals, and I recognize the contributions this course has made
                    toward
                    helping me achieve those goals.</span></p>
            <h2 class="c10" id="h.2js4c95jy9xx"><span>Learning Outcomes</span></h2>
            <h3 class="c5" id="h.3xdpofydben5"><span class="c4">Rhetoric</span></h3>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Major Project 3 provides an excellent example of applying rhetoric in this
                    course. In
                    MP3, we created 3 deliverables/documents, each with a different purpose, audience, and context for
                    its use.
                    This required deliberate consideration of how to properly tailor each to the intended audience.
                    I&rsquo;d
                    like to examine the rhetorical choices for the brochure template we created to showcase this
                    learning
                    outcome.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c2">For the brochure template, our audience was prospective members that may be
                    interested in the club. As the lead on the brochure in my group, I made the important decisions
                    regarding
                    tone, visuals, and what information to include. Because the purpose of the brochure is to attract
                    new
                    students to join the club, a major rhetorical choice I made was to use friendly, informal language,
                    almost
                    as if the brochure was speaking directly to the reader. The previous game visuals in the brochure
                    are
                    intended to grab the audience&rsquo;s attention, while the last part of the brochure has the call to
                    actions
                    to check out VGDev&rsquo;s website and to join their Discord. </span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c2">For additional rationale behind the other deliverables, my <a
                        href="resources/memo.pdf" target="_blank">MP3 Collaboration
                        Reflection Memo</a> has more in-depth information in the &ldquo;Communication Choices&rdquo;
                    section.</span></p>
            <h3 class="c5" id="h.b6r14syvr3ug"><span>Process</span></h3>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c2">The idea of assignments as an iterative process has been present for me
                    throughout
                    this course. I started most deliverables (including this self-assessment) with just short,
                    detail-oriented
                    bullet points as a brainstorming process to get my ideas written down before moving on to filling in
                    the
                    rest. In MP2, I did this with my partner, David, to frame the most important parts of our research
                    about the
                    CrowdStrike incident. We also used the document to gather research sources and write down questions
                    to
                    consider while we conducted our research. <a href="resources/research_doc.pdf"
                        target="_blank">I&rsquo;ll link the document here.</a></span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c2">This document represents an important part of the process for Major Project
                    2. We
                    began our information collecting in this document, and starting considering what would be most
                    important to
                    our audience (the class and our instructor) to help us decide what should later be included on our
                    poster.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c2">MP2 also represents the iterative and revision-based nature of technical
                    communication, seen best in the differences between our <a href="resources/draft_poster.pdf"
                        target="_blank">draft</a> and <a href="resources/poster.pdf" target="_blank">final</a> poster.
                    In our draft, we
                    have almost
                    too much whitespace, our graph is not directly relevant to our research question, and we were
                    lacking some
                    of the analysis in our discussion. We realized these shortcomings through feedback from our peers
                    and
                    instructor, as well as self-reflection, and were able to revise these things to improve them for our
                    final
                    poster. In contrast with the issues I described, our final graphic is important context for
                    answering our
                    research question, and we were able to revise our results and discussion sections to focus on the
                    more
                    important pieces of our findings.</span></p>
            <h3 class="c5" id="h.r2x6r4ndyxp4"><span>Modes and Media</span></h3>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c2">The multimedia nature of our MP3 deliverables provides another opportunity to
                    examine
                    them in relation to a learning outcome. Each of our deliverables utilizes multiple WOVEN components.
                    Our
                    brochure template, utilizes friendly, persuasive writing, visuals of previous games&rsquo; titles,
                    and a
                    colorful scheme that is meant to catch passerby&rsquo;s eyes. Our Github demo video on the other
                    hand
                    utilizes mostly oral and visual components. The oral component provides the majority of the tutorial
                    information, while the visuals on screen keep watchers interested, and supports their learning by
                    providing
                    a 1-to-1 of what their screens should look like as an example. </span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Each individual WOVEN component of our deliverables would be useful in their
                    own way,
                    but we were able to effectively combine them to create more compelling deliverables that serve their
                    purpose
                    all the more effectively.</span></p>
            <h3 class="c5" id="h.vwyoakcb0q5h"><span>Design</span></h3>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c2">To illustrate how I applied design this semester, I&rsquo;d like to showcase
                    my
                    resume from MP1. I made several considerations on how to most effectively design and organize my
                    resume,
                    considering importance of information, how to provide information concisely, and how to maintain
                    high
                    clarity. When choosing and ordering the sections, I thought about what a recruiter might first want
                    to see
                    from a new college graduate, and used this to outline my resume. Further design decisions I made
                    (along with
                    using feedback from others) were to bold the buzzwords relating to cybersecurity skills and to
                    left-align
                    section and subsection headers, where the recruiter&rsquo;s eyes would likely be trailing down.
                    Overall,
                    these decisions helped to make my resume accessible and concise, but also eye-catching in the areas
                    that are
                    most important.</span></p>
            <h2 class="c10" id="h.wvt4sgd7f3rl"><span>Final Grade</span></h2>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Based on the summation of all of my effort this semester and the information
                    I have
                    presented in this portfolio, I propose an A as my grade in this course.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Considering the more basic expectations for an A: I have submitted all 6
                    career blogs
                    (with one incomplete, but revised/resubmitted entry at time of writing), meet the attendance
                    requirement,
                    and I have actively contributed to our class community. I participate in class discussions, both at
                    the
                    table and to the class as a whole. I have consistently provided in-depth and considerate feedback to
                    other
                    students which I believe is another form of community contribution.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Not only have I completed each major assignment with full effort, but I think
                    that I
                    have consistently shown effort in advancing my understanding of the course outcomes throughout each
                    assignment. I have been making deliberate rhetorical decisions, iterating upon my work, creating
                    WOVEN
                    deliverables, and creating effective and efficient designs.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span>Reflecting upon shortcomings of mine from this semester, I believe that my incomplete
                    Career
                    Blog Entry #3 post is the most significant among them, and I have submitted a revision to remedy
                    this. I
                    also think that some of my drafts should have been more complete to facilitate better peer feedback,
                    especially for the MP3 brochure. Several of the visuals and written components were missing when I
                    submitted
                    it, so feedback was more sparse.</span></p>

                    portfolio website to establish my identity as a candidate to recruiters. In particular, this project
                    illustrated my understanding of how to effectively adjust my job materials for a specific role. In
                    my cover letter, I made intentional efforts to discuss language and skills directly from the job

                <p class="intro-box">In this project I worked with a partner to research a technical communication
                    crisis create a research poster, and present it to the class. We selected the CrowdStrike incident
                    from 2024 where we examined a number of primary and secondary sources to better understand the
                    communication surrounding the incident. We then drew our own conclusions about the successes and
                    fails of the technical communication surrounding the incident, and created the poster accordingly.
                    This project showcased my design and rhetoric skills especially, as we needed to give a convincing
                    argument for the conclusions we made about the incident using both the visual poster and our spoken
                    presentation. Combining the visual, oral, and written components in this project was essential for
                    constructing the most effective argument.

                <h3>Major Project 3 - VGDev Technical Communication Toolkit</h3>
                <p class="intro-box">In this project, we created a technical communication toolkit for the Georgia Tech
                    student organization VGDev. We first looked at the technical communication needs of the
                    organization, and found that their on-campus recruiting as well as new member onboarding could be
                    improved. To this end, we created two different deliverables. The first was a brochure template to
                    recruit new members, while the second was a Github demo video to teach freshman and other new
                    members new to Github the VGDev workflow using Github. Finally, we created a recommendation report
                    to be presented to VGDev leadership to persuade them to use the materials we created, and provide
                    any other useful recommendations we came up with. This project required a lot of thought put into
                    the rhetoric behind the deliverables to most effectively persuade our audience for the deliverable's
                    intended purpose. We considered who might read/use our materials, and how best to communicate with
                    them.</p>
